Have a look at the Flowchart(svg-open in a new tab or pdf) to understand the app's flow and logic.

In Application Flowchart following is the indicative colour scheme :

* Dotted arrows indicates DB interaction and the functions which make them have blue background
+ The flow marked my blue arrow's is the main closed loop which fuels the data collection and the roulette
+ The functions with yellow background take inputs from the user 
+ The function in the green background is the main evaluation function , which has been documented in update_function.pdf
